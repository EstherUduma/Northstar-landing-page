<h1>Northstar Landing Page</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project happens to be my second landing page project. It's a landing page for a Paid finance guide website that enables clients get finance advice for a fee. This happens to be the first time i got to use svgs. I actually prefer them to images because of their flexibility. At the time i created this, it was a big deal for me. Lol.
